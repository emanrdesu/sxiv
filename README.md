# sxiv
My build of sxiv.

_Note_: **There is https://github.com/nsxiv/nsxiv which is a 'new' mantained version of sxiv** (Worth taking a look).

# Instalation
```
sudo make install clean
```

_NOTE:_ If you are comming from a minimal set up, the only packages that you need, and you haven't installed sxiv before, from source, you may need these (_example_: on VoidLinux):
```
imlib2-devel libexif-devel giflib-devel
```

# Features

* You can navigate with j/k and scroll with h/j/k/l (when zoomed in, you can scroll; or else navigate to the next/prev image)
* Square-shaped "marks" and highlighted images in "thumbnail mode".
* Syncs with pywal by default
* More thumbnail adjustment on config.h
* With Enter, you quit sxiv and output the name of the image(s) that were selected
* Navigate to random image
* Scale to fill the window
* Stream images directly from the web (example: `sxiv 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/explosion-mental/sxiv/main/sxiv.png'` )
* _Single recursive_ with -r. ( example: `sxiv -r image.png` will scan the whole directory for images in which `image.png` is located, if you want true recursivess, all subdirs also, use -R ) _Note:_ or just simly use the '.' directory, like `sxiv .`

## Key Handler
With the patch I made (I'll formatting correctly), there's no need for
"prefix-key" to execute a command on keyhandler, pretty stuff! Although there
are **two** options:
1. With the default one, on `main.c`, you will **only** be able to execute
   something on the keyhandler if that key isn't bound on config.h (i.e.,
   config.h dominates).
2. The other option is to have them _simultaneously_, if the key that you
pressed is on config.h try to execute the command that is on command.c (i.e.,
the normal sxiv commands) or else search it on the keyhandler (that's why on
every other key it will always be searching for it, as you can see on the bar
when pressing keys that aren't on the keyhandler, sometimes it executes faster
so it seems like it doesn't show up).
  - With this kind of handling the handler you can do pretty stuff like bind
    SCALE_FIT to "w" and, on the key-handler, bound also "w" to
    [setbg](https://github.com/explosion-mental/scripts/blob/main/setbg). The
    result would be, if SCALE_FIT can be executed then run it else search on
    key-handler, basically if the image is zoomed in/out or in other SCALE mode
    (if it can be SCALEd to FIT) do it, but if it's already "fit" then set the
    img as a wallpaper (setbg script).

(I personally prefer the first way, because even I don't use the bar, the text
saying _Keyhandler..._ annoys me and makes me think its searching on the
keyhandler when it's not needed.)

## [Count]
- A vim inspired way of multiplying the keystrokes of movement & modification.
- Example: Pressing `10` and 'G' (which is for the "nth" image or defaults to
  the last image in absence of `n`) takes you to the 10th image.
- Say you type `5` & `}`, this would add '+5' to the Gamma and so on.
  - Of couse not all commands have that but some of them do. I don't really use
    this 'feature'. I noticed it's a bit slow (or maybe it's probably just me)
  - You can toggle it on/off by uncommentting/commenting it in config.mk. I
    don't know any other way to do this, hopefully it's not a terrible thing.
    You also need to change the number keys in the key-handler (by default in
    `~/config/sxiv/exec/key-handler) to letters (or whatever you want), to make
    remove conflicts.

# Patches
Just look them up
[here](https://github.com/explosion-mental/sxiv/tree/main/patches), most of
them aren't on this build.

## Thanks
Base fork is [qsmodo fork](https://github.com/qsmodo/sxiv/commits/master) , which I liked but needed to make changes.


Really usefull repo [0ion9 fork](https://github.com/0ion9/sxiv) , which is too complicated for me to understand.

# Contribute!
- What's the best position/intuitive (preferably not with Shift) for some
  actions on sxiv?
- Write about interesting features!

# TODO
- Load all frames from TIFF files. We have to write our own loader for this to
  happen--just like we did for GIF images--because Imlib2 does not support
  multiple frames. Issue #241.
- Add support for more embedded thumbnail formats. Right now, sxiv seems to use
  the smallest one. Issue #238.

# My Build Todos
- Autoreload feature? (It needs to reload images when invoke keyhandler? the markcnt doesn't update after moving files to other directory with a keyhandler command)
- Better use of space
- '-T' for title
- If the bar is hidden in image mode, toggle the bar while switching modes (maybe bar is always shown in "thumbnail mode"? 	cg_toggle_bar();)
- Which color would be a nice one for the marks?
- toggle square thumbnails on run time
- When searching recursively (i.e., search all images in the directory and subdirs), images names on the bar are displayed. I would like to know in which directory am I (dirname), so how to show the subdirectory of the directory in which sxiv was called to be recursive.
- Remove all position modificacion (zoom, rotation) RESTORE to default?, so reload image
- Make '#ifdef' on tns_move_selection. That is, how to remove the 'cnt' var?
- If only one image given match background color to the image.
- <s>Is there a way to scroll & not navigate in WIDTH mode? (usefull on some memes, and comics)<s>
- <s>'-d' for dmenu like output?</s> Why have a flag, a command added called dmenu_output added ☑️
- <s>After adding the padding patch, I found a screenshot of my dwm bar which is really wide but not with much height. When I marked it in "thumbnail mode" on some of the smalls zooms the image dissapears (the image was almost as thick as the marks)</s>
- <s>How to loop on the command 'cg_navigate_marked'? (on marked images)</s> Done✅
- <s>Actual support for clipboard, I use xsel just because clipmenu use it (I don't want to fork it now but some time I will in order to work with xclip)</s> I use xclip now✅
- <s>version.h useless</s>✅
- <s>Make "if" statement (either '#if' or 'if') on a value or definition on the config.mk in order to make `count` (that is: when pressing a number (like '10'), sxiv's default behaviour would be to wait for the next command. Let's say, again, after those two keys you press G (which is bounded to the command 'n_or_last') that means you would go '10' images "down". I don't really use this but I supposed that there are people who find this usefull, so I'm thinking a way to make that optional (user decides).</s> Done✅. You decide if you want that or not (which i believe is just there for some reason) See the `[Count]`
- <s>Is there a way to maximaze space in "thumbnail mode"?</s> Done☑️ Use **Square thumbnails**

# Major improvements:
- More responsive after WM_HINTS patch
- Compile even if sxiv is active _(cp -f)_
- version.h not needed (one less file)
- Not an improvement but for my standards of understading: I make a config.mk _just like st, dwm and dmenu_ so you can configure it I guess, also the autoreload_inotify/nop was annoying so I combine them into **one** file, if you want the autoreload before it, add it on the Makefile. Because of this 'suckless' style, the compile messages are alike (I'm debating this, the initial messages where really clean and I like them, suggest something maybe?)
- Saner config.h (Mar 24)
- On/off Prefix-keys on *some* commands(Mar 25)
- Streaming url images (May 25)
- scroll on WIDTH mode (Feb 06 2022)
